Where to start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A good place to start is the "doc" directory, where you
will find  "user" guides for the MOM.

How to run the MOM tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read:

http://mom-ocean.science/web/docs/project/quickstart

Or:

doc/web/quickstart.md


Warning: The Solo and Coupled run scripts have been tested only on 10 and 24, ia64
         processors respectively.
Warning: Some of these tests require a large disk space to save the input data.
         Choose a partition with enough space (1-2 G) to untar the code and data bundels.
Warning: If you want to use the same root directory for all three experiments we suggest to
         compile in the order of increasing complexity: solo -> coupled -> ebm .
         You may have to remove some of the existing .o and .mod files
         if you want to compile ebm experiment after the coupled experiment.
         E.g., you probably have to:   cd ../exec; rm mpp*.o mpp*.mod fms_io*.o fms_io*.mod

Note:    IBM platform users might want to add the following line to the top of the run scripts
             setenv LDR_CNTRL MAXDATA=0xD0000000@DSA


Note:    The compile scripts provide the basic capability to use static memory allocation
         which might be faster on some platforms. In that case you need to adjust the values
         of domain bounds properly according to the number of processors and layout.
